# CIP 1776: A Better Model For Decentralized Governance 

## Abstract
CIP 1776 proposes a comprehensive, decentralized, and balanced on-chain governance mechanism for the Cardano network. By balancing voting leverage between The Constitutional Court, Stake Pool Operators, and Delegated Representatives, this proposal seeks to create a system that ensures no single entity or group holds too much power or influence over the network's decision-making process. Furthermore, the proposal introduces a minimum viable Cardano Constitution, providing a guiding framework for governance actions and decisions.

We propose a modular system of governance and call for a revision of Cardano's on-chain governance system to support this proposal. Under our proposal, any Cardano user will be able to submit a governance action for consideration. The ratification of governance actions will be the responsibility of the following parties:

    1. Voters & Delegated Representatives (DReps)
    2. Stake Pool Operators (SPO)
    3. The Constitutional Court (CC)
